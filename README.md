### Section 1: About This Project

Challenge 4, the BISHO's Market Research Blog project is about making a blog where Bisho can internally post and discuss ideas.

### Section 2: Getting Started

To make this project work we must use local storage, to store messages, and th user preferences on the site.

**What is being saved:**

Post Meta-data:

Post meta data is saved to the local memeory in a unique way, in order to never overwrite the post history each post is tagged with the current time elapsed since 01/01/1970, and then called back as a post if it is tagged with the post data tag. 

```
Darkmode Preferences:
In order to ensure the user is comfortable a dark mode option is included, and when turned on will be saved to local memory in order to be propagated to all html files.
```
